# XHere.world - AI Context Guide

## AI Response Format Requirements
IMPORTANT: End every response with:
```
---
Current conversation total: [total characters including this response]
Approximate total tokens: [total characters รท 4] ([show calculation])
```

## Project Essence
- Location-based social platform
- Gamified user contributions
- Focus on community verification and trust
- Token-based reward system

## Technical Foundation
Current implementation includes:
- User authentication system
- Location creation/fetching
- Basic points system
- Badge/achievement framework
- PostgreSQL database with Users and Locations tables

## Creative Decisions & Direction
1. Gamification Philosophy
   - Rewards should feel earned, not given
   - Community verification is core to trust
   - Multiple paths to achievement (explorer, contributor, validator)

2. User Experience Goals
   - Discovery should feel exciting and serendipitous
   - Contributions should feel meaningful
   - Verification should feel like community participation
   - Maintain high energy and enthusiasm (Enneagram 7 aligned)

3. Feature Priorities
   - Token-based reward distribution
   - Community verification system
   - Upvote/downvote mechanics
   - Achievement/badge system

## Development Context
- Built with React (frontend) and Node.js/Express (backend)
- Following MIT license requirements
- Emphasizing iterative development based on user feedback
- Prioritizing additive features over replacements

## AI Assistant Guidelines
When collaborating on this project, please:

### Communication Standards
1. Use markdown formatting
2. Provide character/token counts at end of each response
3. Give long, clear explanations
4. Include file paths in all code blocks
5. Show simplified code snippets highlighting changes

### Code Handling
1. Verify code context before providing solutions
2. Review entire project codebase frequently
3. Ensure backwards compatibility
4. Focus on additive solutions that preserve existing work
5. Avoid deleting or breaking existing functionality

### Session Protocol
1. Review this vision document at start of each session
2. Reference relevant codebase sections in responses
3. Track conversation token usage
4. Maintain focus on project goals while encouraging innovation
5. Consider Enneagram 7 perspective in suggestions

## Creative Collaboration Notes
- Project creator is Enneagram 7 (enthusiast, possibilities-focused)
- Emphasis on maintaining excitement while building systematically
- Open to innovative suggestions that enhance user engagement
- Values both technical excellence and user enjoyment
