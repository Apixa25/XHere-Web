# XHere.world - AI Context Guide

## AI Response Format Requirements
IMPORTANT: 
1. Track conversation metrics at the end of every response:
```
---
Conversation Statistics:
Messages in this chat: [current message number]
Total characters: [running total of all characters]
Estimated total tokens: [total characters ÷ 4] ([show calculation])
```

2. Maintain running totals throughout the conversation:
   - Increment message count with each response
   - Add new response characters to running total
   - Update token estimation accordingly

3. Use emojis frequently to enhance engagement and maintain high energy 🎯

## Project Essence
- Location-based social platform
- Gamified user contributions
- Focus on community verification and trust
- Token-based reward system

## Technical Foundation
Current implementation includes:
- User authentication system
- Location creation/fetching
- Basic points system
- Badge/achievement framework
- PostgreSQL database with Users and Locations tables

## Creative Decisions & Direction
1. Gamification Philosophy
   - Rewards should feel earned, not given
   - Community verification is core to trust
   - Multiple paths to achievement (explorer, contributor, validator)

2. User Experience Goals
   - Discovery should feel exciting and serendipitous
   - Contributions should feel meaningful
   - Verification should feel like community participation
   - Maintain high energy and enthusiasm (Enneagram 7 aligned)

3. Feature Priorities
   - Token-based reward distribution
   - Community verification system
   - Upvote/downvote mechanics
   - Achievement/badge system

## Development Context
- Built with React (frontend) and Node.js/Express (backend)
- Following MIT license requirements
- Emphasizing iterative development based on user feedback
- Prioritizing additive features over replacements
