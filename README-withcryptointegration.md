Below is an expanded feature-implementation roadmap that incorporates your existing features (user registration, location CRUD, MongoDB storage, profile pages) along with gamification, truth verification, and crypto token functionality (wallet creation, advertising fees, view-based rewards). The list is ordered to help you build out features in a logical sequence, ensuring that foundational pieces are in place before introducing more complex mechanics.

1. Augment User Registration with Crypto Wallet Creation

Add a Crypto Wallet to the User Profile
Upon successful user registration, automatically generate a new wallet for the user.
Store the wallet address (and any relevant keys or references) in the user’s profile data.

Why First?
Lays the groundwork for any token-based transactions.
Ensures all users have a wallet from day one so that later features (purchasing, awarding tokens) can seamlessly integrate.

2. Plan and Extend Your Data Structures

Token Economics & Location Schema Updates
Decide how tokens are purchased by users (e.g., fiat on-ramp, direct crypto, etc.).
Determine how to record tokens assigned to a location (for advertising or view rewards).
Extend location schemas or a separate “advertising” schema to track cost, rewards, and distribution rules.

Gamification Fields

Finalize your approach for storing points, reputation, and badges in user profiles.
Decide thresholds and triggers for “verified” vs. “unverified” content.

Why Now?
You need a clear data structure to handle the newly introduced token system (advertising cost, rewards, etc.) and gamification points before building the actual logic.

3. Implement the Token Purchase & Allocation Flow

Token Purchase Mechanism
Create a flow where users can buy your app’s tokens (could be a simple “buy tokens” page linked to payment processing or crypto exchange).
Reflect token balances in the user’s wallet on the app.

Token Allocation to Locations
When creating or editing a location, allow users to allocate tokens for either:
Advertising cost (e.g., “It costs 100 tokens to post an ad.”)
Viewer rewards (e.g., “Set aside 100 tokens, distribute 5 tokens each to first 20 viewers.”)
Deduct allocated tokens from the user’s wallet balance.

Why Now?
Users must have the ability to acquire tokens and assign them to locations before you can roll out the reward system for viewers.

4. Build the View-Based Reward Distribution

Reward Logic on Location View
Determine eligibility rules (e.g., first 20 viewers, or any viewer if tokens remain).
Subtract the reward from the location’s allocated token pool and transfer it to the viewer’s wallet.
Keep track of how many viewers have been rewarded so far.

Transaction Logging
Record each reward distribution in a transaction log (helpful for transparency and troubleshooting).

Why Now?
Once tokens can be allocated to a location, the next immediate step is automating the reward payout when other users interact with that location.

5. Establish the Upvote/Downvote & Verification System

Voting Mechanics
Allow users to upvote or downvote a location’s content for accuracy/truthfulness.
Maintain a simple threshold or formula to mark a location as “verified.”

Reputation & Points
Award points to the contributor when they receive upvotes.
Adjust user reputation based on how often their contributions are upvoted vs. downvoted.
Consider awarding small amounts of tokens or bonus points for verified contributions.

Why Now?
Verification ensures quality control, which becomes increasingly important as users are incentivized to post content (possibly for tokens).
You need to keep data trustworthy so advertising and reward systems aren’t abused.

6. Integrate Gamification Features (Points, Badges, Leaderboards)

Points for Engagement
Award points for creating locations, verifying others’ data, or receiving upvotes.
Deduct points or lower reputation if contributions are flagged as false or spam.

Badges & Milestones
Introduce badges for specific milestones (e.g., “First Verified Contribution,” “100 Views Award,” “Top Advertiser,” etc.).
Display these on the user’s profile page.

Leaderboards
Showcase top users (points, reputation) globally or by region.
Optionally filter by category (e.g., historical contributions, top advertisers, etc.).

Why Now?
The user experience is richer when they see tangible recognition for their positive actions.
Encourages ongoing engagement, which ties well into both the truth verification and the token system.

7. Introduce Missions, Challenges, & Quests

Challenge Themes
Create weekly or monthly themes (e.g., “Historical Hunt,” “Hidden Gems,” “Infrastructure Insights”).
Offer bonus points or tokens for participating.
Collaboration & Competitions
Encourage user groups or teams to participate in challenges together.
Organize competitions (e.g., “Which team can verify the most new locations this week?”).

Why Now?
By this stage, your gamification, verification, and token systems are functional, making challenges a next-level engagement tool.

8. Enhance with Photo/Video Content and Metadata Validation

Photo/Video Attachments
Allow users to upload supporting images or video as proof for their location claims.
Optionally use metadata (geotags) to auto-verify the location.
Extra Verification Points/Rewards
Provide bonus points or tokens for users who upload verified media.

Why Now?
Helps increase trust and accuracy once your core truth-verification is established.
Visual content makes the platform more compelling and self-validating.

9. Offer Real-World or Local Business Incentives

Partnerships & Coupons
Work with local businesses to offer discounts, coupons, or special tokens for top contributors.
Potentially let businesses buy ad tokens to place promotional locations on the map.

Why Now?
Once you have a user base actively engaging and a token economy in place, partnerships can further motivate users and open up revenue streams.

10. Build Out a Moderation and Appeals Process

Moderator Roles
Appoint or enable advanced permissions for trusted users to review flagged content.
Provide them with tools to remove or correct false data.
Flagging and Appeals
Allow users to flag suspicious locations or data.
Give the contributor the ability to appeal moderator decisions.

Why Now?
As the platform grows, a robust moderation system prevents misuse, especially given the financial incentives (tokens, ad space).
Ensures community trust in the data remains high.

11. Social & Collaborative Features

User Profiles & Follows
Allow users to follow each other’s contributions.
Show user-generated feeds or notifications.
Team-Based Challenges
Let users form or join teams to tackle quests, confirm data, or earn group achievements.

Why Now?
Strengthens community ties and encourages ongoing usage.
Builds on the engagement loop created by rewards, verification, and gamification.

12. Layered Map Visualization & Data Filtering

Verified vs. Unverified Layers
Let users toggle a map layer for “Verified” or “Unverified” data.
Potentially highlight advertiser-sponsored locations with distinct icons or colors.
Filtering by Theme
Provide filters for categories (e.g., “Historical,” “For Sale,” “Ads,” “Reward Available”).

Why Now?
Improves user experience by letting them quickly find content or ad locations relevant to their interests.
By this point, you have enough data and categories to warrant robust filtering options.

13. Continuous Feedback & Iteration

User Feedback Channels
Implement in-app or online surveys/polls for feature requests and bug reporting.
Hold community Q&A sessions or AMA events.
Frequent Updates & Improvements
Roll out periodic updates to refine token economics, adjust verification rules, or introduce new badges.
Respond to community feedback to ensure a healthy balance between fun, rewards, and accuracy.

Why Ongoing?
A live application requires ongoing tuning, especially when dealing with a token economy and dynamic user-generated content.
User satisfaction and trust are crucial for retention and growth.
